# The Origin of the Mountains and Seas – Story Overview (English Version)

From beyond the stars, a dark force sought to conquer Earth, intending to drain its resources and fuel its own growing dominion. In the face of this apocalyptic threat, Nüwa, the guardian goddess, sacrificed herself to drive the darkness beyond the sky, sealing it away at the edge of the universe.

Yet, a single wisp of the dark force’s soul slipped through the cracks. It fled to the Southern Sea, hiding in the abyss, and when the first light of dawn broke, it abducted a young boy. That soul fragment fused into the child, intending to possess him—transforming the boy into a puppet for its evil ambitions. The dark soul retreated to the Central Sea, a forbidden zone shrouded in peril, where no one dared to venture.

In secret, the Prince of the Southern Sea formed a sinister pact with this surviving wraith. To preserve his power, he murdered Yinglong’s mother, who had tried to expose the truth. As payment, the prince was forced to carry out terrible acts, even aiding in the dark force’s plot to destroy the world. Eventually, his betrayal led to his own undoing.

Far away, Jingwei, daughter of scholars who once painted the ancient Shan Hai Map, studied her parents’ lost manuscripts and made a vow—to travel across the land, redrawing the legendary map and uncovering the secrets buried within. She set off with Yinglong, her first companion, heading toward Mount Zhongshan.

On their journey, they passed through Mount Nanshan, where they rescued a young warrior named Houyi, who was being hunted down by debt collectors due to an extortionate loan. Grateful and full of righteous fire, Houyi joined their cause without hesitation.

In Zhongshan, the group met Youyou, daughter of Nüwa and guardian of the sacred temple. Recognizing Jingwei as a descendant of the ancient mapmakers, Youyou revealed the truth of the past and her mother’s sacrifice. Together, the four heroes decided to seek the wisdom of Queen Mother of the West, ruler of the Celestial Realm.

There, they learned the origin of the dark force: Shangjin, once a mighty hero and sworn brother of Pangu, the one who split heaven and earth. Shangjin had not been chosen by the Queen Mother to shape the world—not because he lacked power, but because his heart was too scheming, his mind too heavy. Enraged, Shangjin created his own twisted realm beyond the stars and plotted to consume the Earth in revenge.

To stop him, the Queen Mother told them they must find the Five-Colored Stones, fragments of the divine Heaven-Mending Stone infused with Nüwa’s soul. Without the Shan Hai Map, the quest was near-impossible. Yet the four set off, facing treacherous trials that tested their strength, spirit, and bond.

Along the way, they encountered:
	•	Heart-wrenching betrayals of family,
	•	Bitter doubts between friends,
	•	Friendship tested to the breaking point,
	•	And even the spark of romance blooming amidst chaos.

Eventually, they discovered the shocking truth: the abducted boy was Huangdi, now the vessel of Shangjin’s soul. Under control, Huangdi was forced to raise his hand against Jingwei—his heart torn by guilt.

But in the final hour, Huangdi broke free of the possession.

With their hearts united, the four heroes and Huangdi confronted Shangjin in a climactic battle, finally defeating him.

As the Four Seas unified once more, Nüwa—before vanishing completely—sealed the center of the Earth, drawing a divine circle to safeguard the future. She appointed Huangdi as the leader of a chosen people, entrusting him to remain within the circle, never to leave, to guard civilization and pass it on.

That place, that story, that legacy… became the dawn of the five-thousand-year Chinese civilization.

And outside the circle, the heroes and their descendants vowed to stand guard for all eternity—so that Earth would never again fall into darkness.
